    abstract = {It is suggested that the motion of pedestrians can be described as if they would be subject to ''social
                forces.'' These ''forces'' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they
                are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The
                corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of
                other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first,
                a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that
                a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling
                attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer
                simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of
                describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very
                realistically. {\textcopyright} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Moussaid:2009,
    abstract = {In animal societies as well as in human crowds, many observed collective behaviours result from
                self-organized processes based on local interactions among individuals. However, models of crowd dynamics
                are still lacking a systematic individual-level experimental verification, and the local mechanisms
                underlying the formation of collective patterns are not yet known in detail. We have conducted a set of
                well-controlled experiments with pedestrians performing simple avoidance tasks in order to determine the
                laws ruling their behaviour during interactions. The analysis of the large trajectory dataset was used to
                compute a behavioural map that describes the average change of the direction and speed of a pedestrian
                for various interaction distances and angles. The experimental results reveal features of the decision
                process when pedestrians choose the side on which they evade, and show a side preference that is
                amplified by mutual interactions. The predictions of a binary interaction model based on the above
                findings were then compared with bidirectional flows of people recorded in a crowded street. Simulations
                generate two asymmetric lanes with opposite directions of motion, in quantitative agreement with our
                empirical observations. The knowledge of pedestrian behavioural laws is an important step ahead in the
                understanding of the underlying dynamics of crowd behaviour and allows for reliable predictions of
                collective pedestrian movements under natural conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

@article{Moussaid:2010,
    abstract = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among
                pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals,
                it turns out that up to 70{\%} of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends,
                couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and
                their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of
                approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among
                group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density,
                group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the
                density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like
                pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between
                group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group,
                but reduces the flow because of its "non-aerodynamic" shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the
                group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange.
                These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by
                other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among
                individuals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Moussaid et al.},
